### Course Description
This course provides an introduction to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), exploring the process of Human-Centered design, the types of interfaces humans can interact with, and the fundamental methods, principles, and tools for analyzing, designing, programming, and testing interactive systems. The course also addresses emotional and social interactions and interaction design in practice.

### Course Objectives
- Introduce the fundamental concepts of Human-Computer Interaction.
- Develop skills to analyze and evaluate existing systems from a human perspective.
- Build the capacity to design software systems using Human-Centered design processes.
- Explore the latest advancements in HCI, including Computational UI, Spatial Computing, and Human-Robot Interaction.

### Student Learning Outcomes (CLOs)
Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to:

   - Explain basic concepts in HCI and its relationship to other fields.
   - Describe various methods for analyzing, designing, programming, and testing interactive systems from a human perspective.
   - Discuss future directions in the field of HCI.
   
   - Conduct primary research with human subjects.
   - Evaluate existing software systems from a human perspective.
   - Design software systems using the Human-Centered process.

   - Empathize with specific user groups to understand their needs.
