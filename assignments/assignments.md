# HCI Assignments Overview

## Introduction

These three assignments guide you through a complete design process with one selected digital product. Each assignment builds on the previous work: Assignment 1 gathers user research, Assignment 2 analyzes data and defines problems, and Assignment 3-4 creates solutions and tests your improvements against the original product.

## Assignment Weights & Timeline

| Assignment | Points | Due Week |
|------------|---------|----------|
| **1:** Discovery | 2 pts | Week 7 |
| **2:** Analysis & Synthesis | 3 pts | Week 10 |
| **3-4:** Ideation, Prototyping & Evaluation | 10 pts | Week 15 |

### 3: Ideation, Prototyping & Evaluation
**Generate solutions, create prototypes, and validate through testing**
- 3 "How Might We" questions
- 30 solution ideas (10 per problem)

## Key Requirements

- **Project Continuity:** Use the same product across all assignments
- **Progressive Build:** Each assignment uses outputs from the previous one
- **Evidence-Based:** All decisions must be supported by research data
