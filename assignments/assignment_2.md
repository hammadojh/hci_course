# Assignment 2: Analysis and Synthesis Phase

## Objective
-------------------
To analyze and synthesize data gathered during the Discovery phase, using various analytical methods to identify themes, user needs, and pain points. This phase will help define clear, actionable problem statements for the next phase.

## Instructions
--------------------
### 1. Data Analysis:
**Quantitative Analysis:**
- Organize and analyze numerical data (e.g., ratings, frequency of feedback themes).
- Create at least three statistical visualizations (e.g., bar charts, pie charts) to summarize key findings.

**Qualitative Analysis:**
- Perform thematic analysis to identify at least 5 recurring themes from user reviews, interviews, and observations.
- Conduct semantic analysis to extract deeper insights from user sentiments.

### 2. Mapping Tools:
- Design a persona for one distinct user group, including their goals, frustrations, and needs.
- Draft three scenarios for your persona, describing its interaction with the product in three different contexts.

### 3. Problem Definition:
- Summarize your analysis and define three main problem statements which should be user-focused, actionable, and rooted in the analysis. An example of a well-defined problem:

"First-time users of the fitness tracking app struggle to log their workouts due to unclear navigation labels and lack of onboarding guidance. This causes frustration, particularly when they are at the gym and need a quick solution, resulting in reduced app usage and poor retention rates. Observational studies showed that 70% of new users abandoned the app after their first attempt to log a workout."

It includes: The User's Goal, The Problem/Pain, The Context, Impact on the User, Evidence, Why It Matters.

- Define 3 user stories that map to each problem statement that defines what users want (what are their goals) and why (the need).

For example from the previous problem statement we can say:

"As a trainee, I want a quick and easy way to log my exercises so that I can focus on my workout."

### 4. Presentation:
- Create a 5-minute presentation to share your key findings, mapping outputs, and problem statements with the class. Focus on clarity, logical flow, and impactful visual aids (e.g., charts, empathy maps).

## Submission
--------------------
- Submit your presentation slides to Blackboard. Be ready to present your findings in the next class.

## Grading Criteria

| Criteria | Excellent (9-10 pts) | Good (7-8 pts) | Satisfactory (5-6 pts) | Needs Improvement (0-4 pts) |
|----------|---------------------|----------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Data Analysis (10 points)** | Both quantitative and qualitative analyses are exceptionally thorough and appropriate. Visualizations are clear, insightful, and well-documented. Themes are comprehensive and well-articulated. | Both analyses are well-conducted and appropriate. Visualizations are clear and adequately documented. Themes are identified and reasonably well-articulated. | Analyses are somewhat thorough but may lack depth. Visualizations are basic but functional. Themes are identified but may be unclear or incomplete. | Analyses are insufficient or inappropriate. Visualizations are unclear or missing. Themes are poorly identified or missing. |
| **Empathy and Mapping (10 points)** | Personas, scenarios, and mapping tools are exceptionally detailed and user-centered. They effectively reflect the analyzed data with rich context and clear user goals. | Mapping tools are detailed and user-centered. They reflect the analyzed data with good context and clear user goals. | Mapping tools are somewhat detailed but may lack depth. They reflect some of the analyzed data but may be generic or unclear. | Mapping tools are insufficient or not user-centered. They poorly reflect the analyzed data or are missing key elements. |
| **Problem Definition (5 points)** | Problem statements are exceptionally clear, actionable, and well-rooted in analysis. User stories are comprehensive and clearly map to problems. | Problem statements are clear, actionable, and based on analysis. User stories are well-defined and map to problems. | Problem statements are somewhat clear but may lack actionability or connection to analysis. User stories are basic but present. | Problem statements are unclear, not actionable, or not based on analysis. User stories are missing or poorly defined. |

Presentation is engaging, clear, and insightful with excellent visual aids. | Report is well-organized and easy to follow. Presentation is clear and informative with good visual aids. | Report is somewhat organized but may be difficult to follow. Presentation is basic but functional with minimal visual aids. | Report is poorly organized and difficult to follow. Presentation is unclear or unengaging with no visual aids. |
