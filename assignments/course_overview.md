# HCI Assignments Overview

## Introduction

These four assignments guide you through a complete design process with one selected digital product. Each assignment builds on the previous work: Assignment 1 gathers user research, Assignment 2 analyzes data and defines problems, Assignment 3 creates solutions, and Assignment 4 tests your improvements against the original product.

## Assignment Weights & Timeline

| Assignment | Points | Due Week |
|------------|---------|----------|
| **1:** Discovery | 2 pts | Week 7 |
| **2:** Analysis & Synthesis | 3 pts | Week 10 |
| **3:** Ideation & Prototyping | 5 pts | Week 13 |
| **4:** Evaluation & Validation | 5 pts | Week 15 |
