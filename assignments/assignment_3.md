# Assignment 3: Ideation and Prototyping Phase

## Objective
-------------------
In this assignment, you will use the user stories that you defined in the previous phase and come up with multiple possible solution ideas.

## Instructions
--------------------
### 1. How Might We (HMW) Questions:
- Create three HMW questions based on your problem statements from the previous phase.

### 2. Ideation:
- Generate 20 quick ideas to solve each problem (sketches).
- Total of 60 ideas across all three problems.

### 3. Prioritization:
- Use a prioritization technique to select the best ideas from your generated list.

### 4. Conceptual Models:
- Create 2 conceptual models based on the top ideas (sketches with more details).

### 5. Prototypes:
- Develop 2 alternative prototypes that combine the best of your ideas (can use ChatGPT).

### 6. Assumptions:
- Document assumptions made for each prototype (to be tested in next phase).

## Submission
--------------------
- Submit your three HMWs.
- Submit 20 quick ideas for each problem (sketches).
- Submit the prioritization technique used for selecting ideas.
- Submit 2 conceptual models based on the top ideas (sketch with more details).
- Submit 2 alternative prototypes that combine the best of your ideas (can use ChatGPT).
- Submit assumptions made for each prototype (to be tested in next phase).

## Grading Criteria
----------------------

| Criteria | Excellent (9-10 pts) | Good (7-8 pts) | Satisfactory (5-6 pts) | Needs Improvement (0-4 pts) |
|----------|---------------------|----------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Ideation (10 points)** | Generated 20+ high-quality, diverse ideas for each problem (60+ total). Ideas show creativity, variety, and address different aspects of the problems. | Generated 15-19 good ideas for each problem (45-57 total). Ideas show creativity and address the problems adequately. | Generated 10-14 basic ideas for each problem (30-42 total). Ideas are somewhat creative but may lack variety or depth. | Generated fewer than 10 ideas per problem (<30 total) or ideas are low quality, uncreative, or don't address the problems. |
| **Prioritization (5 points)** | Used a sophisticated prioritization technique with clear justification. Process is well-documented and shows thoughtful analysis of idea selection. | Used an appropriate prioritization technique with good justification. Process is documented and shows reasonable analysis. | Used a basic prioritization technique with some justification. Process is minimally documented. | Used no clear prioritization technique or process is poorly documented with no justification. |
| **Conceptual Models (5 points)** | Created 2+ detailed, well-thought-out conceptual models that clearly represent the solution ideas. Models are comprehensive and show deep understanding. | Created 2 conceptual models that represent the solution ideas well. Models are detailed and show good understanding. | Created 2 basic conceptual models that represent some aspects of the solution ideas. Models are somewhat detailed. | Created fewer than 2 models or models are unclear, incomplete, or don't represent the solution ideas. |
| **Prototypes (5 points)** | Developed 2+ high-quality, functional prototypes that effectively combine the best ideas. Prototypes are well-executed and clearly demonstrate the solutions. | Developed 2 good prototypes that combine the best ideas effectively. Prototypes are functional and demonstrate the solutions. | Developed 2 basic prototypes that combine some ideas. Prototypes are functional but may lack polish or clarity. | Developed fewer than 2 prototypes or prototypes are non-functional, unclear, or don't demonstrate the solutions. |
| **Assumptions (5 points)** | Documented comprehensive, well-articulated assumptions for each prototype with clear rationale and testability. | Documented good assumptions for each prototype with reasonable rationale and testability. | Documented basic assumptions for each prototype with some rationale. | Documented few or unclear assumptions, or assumptions lack rationale or testability. |
