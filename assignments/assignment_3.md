# Assignment 3: Ideation, Prototyping, and Evaluation

## Objective
-------------------
In this assignment, you will use the user stories from the previous phase to generate solution ideas, create prototypes, and validate your design through user testing.

## Instructions
--------------------
### 1. How Might We (HMW) Questions:
- Create three HMW questions based on your problem statements from the previous phase.

### 2. Ideation:
- Generate 10 quick ideas to solve each problem (sketches).
- Total of 30 ideas across all three problems.

### 3. Prioritization:
- Use a prioritization technique to select the best ideas from your generated list.

### 4. Prototypes:
- Develop 2 alternative prototypes that combine the best of your ideas (can use ChatGPT).
- Document key assumptions made for each prototype.

### 5. Evaluation Planning:
- Choose your best prototype for testing.
- Define 2 metrics that you assume your solution will perform better than existing solutions.
- Select appropriate evaluation methods for each metric (e.g., satisfaction → survey, efficiency → task timing).

### 6. User Testing:
- Recruit 3 people to conduct the experiment with.
- Create a simple study plan including:
  - The tasks users will perform
  - A brief script to read before the task
- Conduct the experiment comparing your solution to an existing one.
- Randomize the order of interfaces to avoid bias.

### 7. Results and Analysis:
- Document metric values for each interface tested.
- Include qualitative observations (quotes, behaviors, etc.).
- Provide screenshots of your prototype.

## Submission
--------------------
- Submit your three HMWs
- Submit 10 quick ideas for each problem (30 total sketches)
- Submit the prioritization technique used
- Submit 2 alternative prototypes with documented assumptions
- Submit evaluation plan with metrics and methods
- Submit user testing results with analysis and screenshots

## Grading Criteria
----------------------

| Criteria | Excellent (9-10 pts) | Good (7-8 pts) | Satisfactory (5-6 pts) | Needs Improvement (0-4 pts) |
|----------|---------------------|----------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Ideation & Prioritization (8 points)** | Generated 10+ high-quality, diverse ideas for each problem (30+ total). Used sophisticated prioritization with clear justification. | Generated 8-9 good ideas per problem (24-27 total). Used appropriate prioritization with good justification. | Generated 6-7 basic ideas per problem (18-21 total). Used basic prioritization with some justification. | Generated fewer than 6 ideas per problem (<18 total) or poor prioritization process. |
| **Prototypes (7 points)** | Developed 2 high-quality, functional prototypes that effectively combine the best ideas. Well-documented assumptions. | Developed 2 good prototypes that combine ideas effectively. Good assumptions documented. | Developed 2 basic prototypes that combine some ideas. Basic assumptions documented. | Fewer than 2 prototypes or prototypes are unclear/non-functional. |
| **Evaluation Design (8 points)** | Metrics are well-defined and measurable. Evaluation methods perfectly suited to metrics. Study plan is comprehensive. | Metrics are clear and measurable. Evaluation methods appropriate. Study plan is well-structured. | Metrics are somewhat defined. Evaluation methods are basic but functional. Study plan is adequate. | Metrics are poorly defined or evaluation methods inappropriate. |
| **Testing & Analysis (7 points)** | Experiment conducted with proper methodology, 3+ participants, and rigorous documentation. Findings well-presented with clear comparisons and insights. | Experiment conducted well with 3 participants and good methodology. Findings clearly presented with good insights. | Experiment conducted with some methodology issues. 2-3 participants. Basic findings presentation. | Poor experiment execution, insufficient participants, or unclear findings presentation. |
