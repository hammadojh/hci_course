# Assignment 4: Evaluation and Validation Phase

## Objective
-------------------
It is time to validate your assumptions. The goal of this assignment is to:
Choose among the different alternative prototypes that you have proposed.
Show that your solution has actually improved the user experience of the previous solution.

## Instructions
--------------------
### 1. Metrics and Evaluation Methods:
- Write down 3 metrics that you assumed your solution will perform better than previous ones.
- Decide what would be the best evaluation method to use in order to measure that (use one method for each metric). For example:
  - Satisfaction → survey (example only)
  - Ease of Use → observation (example only)
  - Efficiency → analytics (example only)

### 2. Study Planning:
- Write a plan for each short study including (at least the following):
  - The assumption (can be written as hypotheses here)
  - The metric that you will use (make sure it is not ambiguous)
  - The type of user that you need for this (refer to your personas)
  - The tasks that you will ask the user to do (justify this)
  - The script that you will read to the user before the task
  - An empty table to fill in the observations

### 3. Experimentation:
- Recruit 3 people to conduct the experiment with.
- Conduct the experiment.
- Each participant should do the tasks on both your solution and the previous solution so that you can compare.
- Make sure to randomize the order of interfaces so that the data do not get biased by the order.

### 4. Report Writing:
- Write the report including:
  - All details of the points above
  - Show the metric values for each interface
  - Write any qualitative observations (quotes, sayings, unspoken behavior, etc.)
  - Include screenshots

## Submission
--------------------
- Submit a presentation combining all phases + this phase.

## Grading Criteria
----------------------

| Criteria | Excellent (9-10 pts) | Good (7-8 pts) | Satisfactory (5-6 pts) | Needs Improvement (0-4 pts) |
|----------|---------------------|----------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Study Design (10 points)** | Metrics are exceptionally well-defined, specific, and measurable. Evaluation methods are perfectly suited to each metric with clear justification. Study plan is comprehensive and well-structured. | Metrics are well-defined and measurable. Evaluation methods are appropriate for each metric with good justification. Study plan is well-structured. | Metrics are somewhat defined but may lack specificity or measurability. Evaluation methods are basic but functional. Study plan is somewhat structured. | Metrics are poorly defined, unclear, or not measurable. Evaluation methods are inappropriate or missing. Study plan is poorly structured or missing. |
| **Experiment Execution (10 points)** | Experiment was conducted flawlessly with proper randomization, 3+ participants, and rigorous methodology. All procedures were followed correctly with detailed documentation. | Experiment was conducted well with proper randomization, 3 participants, and good methodology. Most procedures were followed correctly with adequate documentation. | Experiment was conducted with some issues in randomization or methodology. 2-3 participants with basic documentation. Some procedures may have been missed. | Experiment was poorly conducted with no randomization, insufficient participants, or major methodological flaws. Poor or missing documentation. |
| **Analysis and Reporting (10 points)** | Findings are exceptionally well-presented with clear metric comparisons, rich qualitative insights, and compelling evidence. Report is comprehensive, well-organized, and includes all required elements with excellent visual aids. | Findings are well-presented with clear metric comparisons and good qualitative insights. Report is well-organized and includes most required elements with good visual aids. | Findings are somewhat presented with basic metric comparisons and some qualitative insights. Report is organized and includes some required elements with basic visual aids. | Findings are poorly presented with unclear or missing metric comparisons. Report is disorganized and missing key elements with no or poor visual aids. |
