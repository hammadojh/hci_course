# Discussion & First Draft Guide

## What is the Discussion & First Draft?

The discussion transforms your objective results into meaningful insights and compiles your entire research journey into a complete academic paper. This is where you interpret findings, connect back to literature, and articulate your contribution to HCI knowledge.

**Your discussion should read like the "Discussion" and "Conclusion" sections in academic papers** - interpreting results, acknowledging limitations, and suggesting future work.

**It's NOT:**
- A repeat of your results without interpretation
- Speculation without evidence from your data
- A literature review rehash

**It IS:**
- Interpretation of your findings in context of existing research
- Critical analysis of what your results mean for HCI
- Integration of all project phases into a coherent research contribution

## Goals

Interpret your results, connect findings to existing literature, articulate theoretical and practical contributions, acknowledge limitations, and present a complete research paper.

## Building on Your Study Report

Your study report provides the **evidence foundation** for interpretation. Every claim in your discussion must be supported by results you've already presented.

**Example Evidence-Based Interpretation:**
> **Result**: "Participants completed tasks 18% faster with haptic feedback (p=.004, d=1.12)"
> **Interpretation**: "This substantial performance improvement supports cognitive load theory, suggesting that haptic feedback reduces visual processing demands, allowing users to allocate attention more effectively during mobile interactions."

## Discussion Framework

Structure your interpretation around key themes:

**1. Findings Interpretation** ‚Üí **What do your results mean?**
- Connect results to theory and prior research
- Explain mechanisms behind observed effects
- *Example: "The performance advantage aligns with dual-coding theory, where haptic and visual channels process information in parallel"*

**2. Literature Integration** ‚Üí **How do findings relate to existing work?**
- Compare with your proxy paper and other literature
- Highlight agreements and contradictions
- *Example: "Unlike Smith et al.'s desktop findings, mobile contexts showed stronger haptic benefits, likely due to visual attention constraints"*

**3. Practical Implications** ‚Üí **What should designers do with this knowledge?**
- Concrete design recommendations
- Implementation considerations
- *Example: "Mobile app designers should prioritize haptic feedback for navigation tasks, especially in contexts where visual attention is divided"*

**4. Theoretical Contributions** ‚Üí **What new knowledge does this add?**
- Novel insights or theoretical extensions
- Methodological innovations
- *Example: "This work extends haptic feedback research to mobile contexts and demonstrates the importance of interaction modality in attention-constrained environments"*

## Discussion Writing Framework

### Interpreting Quantitative Results
**Pattern**: State finding ‚Üí Explain mechanism ‚Üí Connect to theory ‚Üí Relate to literature

**Example**:
> "Participants showed 18% faster task completion with haptic feedback (t(19)=3.24, p=.004, d=1.12). This improvement likely occurs because haptic cues reduce visual processing load, allowing users to maintain spatial awareness while focusing on task content. This aligns with Wickens' multiple resource theory, which predicts performance benefits when information is distributed across sensory modalities. Our findings extend Smith et al.'s desktop results to mobile contexts, where visual attention constraints make haptic feedback particularly valuable."

### Interpreting Qualitative Results
**Pattern**: Present theme ‚Üí Provide evidence ‚Üí Explain significance ‚Üí Connect to broader implications

**Example**:
> "Participants consistently reported initial adaptation challenges with haptic feedback ('It felt weird at first' - P7), but developed strong preferences after extended use ('I really missed it when it was gone' - P14). This adaptation pattern suggests that haptic feedback benefits may not be immediately apparent in short-term usability studies, highlighting the importance of longitudinal evaluation in mobile interface research."

## Writing Tips for Discussion

### Do's:
- **Start with your strongest findings** - Lead with most significant results
- **Use hedging language appropriately** - "suggests," "indicates," "appears to"
- **Connect every claim to evidence** - Reference specific results
- **Acknowledge alternative explanations** - Consider other interpretations
- **Be specific about implications** - Concrete recommendations, not vague suggestions

### Don'ts:
- Over-interpret limited data
- Ignore non-significant or unexpected results
- Make claims beyond your study scope
- Repeat results without adding interpretation
- Forget to address your original research question

## Common Discussion Pitfalls

**‚ùå Avoid These Mistakes:**
- Claiming causation from correlational data
- Generalizing beyond your participant population
- Ignoring study limitations
- Making unsupported theoretical claims
- Forgetting practical implications

**‚úÖ Best Practices:**
- Interpret results in context of study limitations
- Acknowledge when findings contradict expectations
- Suggest specific future research directions
- Balance theoretical and practical contributions
- Maintain humble tone about contribution scope
