# Literature Review Guide

## What is a Literature Review?

A literature review is a comprehensive survey of existing research on your chosen topic. Think of it as creating a map of what researchers have already discovered, what questions they've answered, and what gaps still exist. 

**Your literature review should read like the "Related Work" or "Literature Review" sections you see in academic papers** - synthesizing multiple studies, identifying patterns, and positioning gaps for future research. 

**It's NOT:**
- A summary of random papers you found
- A collection of paper abstracts
- Your personal opinions about the topic

**It IS:**
- A systematic exploration of existing research
- An analysis of themes, patterns, and gaps in the literature
- A foundation that positions your future research in context
- A demonstration that you understand the current state of knowledge

## Goals of the Literature Review

By the end of your literature review, you should be able to:

1. **Map the Field**: Understand what researchers have studied in your area
2. **Identify Patterns**: Recognize common themes, methods, and findings
3. **Spot Gaps**: Find areas where more research is needed
4. **Position Your Work**: Understand how your future study will contribute
5. **Build Credibility**: Show that you're informed about existing work

## Where to Find Sources

### Search Strategy
1. Start with 2-3 key terms from your research question
2. Look at the "Related Work" sections of papers you find
3. Follow citation trails (who cited this paper?)
4. Use author names to find more of their work

## How to Read an Academic Paper

*Based on guidance from [Georgia Tech's research guide](https://omscs6460.gatech.edu/research-guide/how-to-read-an-academic-paper/)*

### Don't Read Cover-to-Cover!
Reading every word is inefficient. Instead, read strategically based on your goals.

### Paper Structure (Most papers follow this)
- **Abstract**: High-level summary
- **Introduction**: The problem and why it matters
- **Related Work**: What others have done
- **Methods**: How they conducted their study
- **Results**: What they found
- **Discussion/Analysis**: What it means
- **Conclusion**: Limitations and future work

### Reading Strategy for Literature Review

**Phase 1: Getting Started (Read 6-8 papers broadly)**
1. **Read the Abstract** - Is this relevant to your topic?
2. **Read the Introduction** - What problem are they solving?
3. **Skim the Conclusion** - What did they find?
4. **Check Related Work** - Find more papers to read

**Phase 2: Going Deeper (Read 3-4 papers thoroughly)**
1. Read everything from Phase 1
2. **Read Methods** - How did they study this?
3. **Read Results** - What exactly did they find?
4. **Read Limitations** - What couldn't they answer?

### What to Look For While Reading
- **Research questions** being asked
- **Methods** used (surveys, experiments, interviews, etc.)
- **Key findings** and conclusions
- **Limitations** mentioned by authors
- **Future work** suggestions
- **Contradictions** between different papers

## Finding Your Proxy Paper

A **proxy paper** is the one study that most closely resembles what you plan to do. This paper will serve as your methodological foundation and help you design your own study.

### What Makes a Good Proxy Paper?
- **Similar research question** to yours (same or very related topic)
- **Similar context** (e.g., mobile apps, VR, web interfaces)
- **Similar user population** (students, professionals, general users)
- **Appropriate methodology** that you could adapt for your study
- **Recent publication** (within last 5 years ideally)

### How to Use Your Proxy Paper:
1. **Study Design Template**: Use their methodology as a starting point
2. **Participant Recruitment**: Learn from their approach to finding participants
3. **Measurement Tools**: Adapt their surveys, tasks, or metrics
4. **Analysis Methods**: Follow similar data analysis approaches
5. **Differentiation**: Clearly explain how your study differs or extends theirs

### Example:
> **Your Research Question**: "Does dark mode improve reading performance on mobile devices?"
> 
> **Good Proxy Paper**: "The Effects of Dark Mode on Reading Performance and Visual Fatigue in Desktop Environments" (Smith et al., 2023)
> 
> **How You'll Extend It**: "We will replicate Smith et al.'s methodology but focus specifically on mobile devices rather than desktop computers, as mobile reading contexts differ significantly in screen size, viewing distance, and usage patterns."

### Questions to Ask About Your Proxy Paper:
- What was their exact methodology?
- What measures did they use?
- How many participants did they recruit?
- What were their key limitations?
- How can you address those limitations in your study?

## What to Submit

Your literature review should be **1-2 pages maximum** and include:

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip for Beginners**: We've designed this to be manageable! You only need 8-12 papers and 1-2 pages total. Quality over quantity - it's better to deeply understand fewer papers than to skim many superficially.

### 1. Introduction
- Your research area and why it's important
- Your specific research question

### 2. Proxy Paper
- Identify **one key paper** that is most similar to your planned research
- Describe what they studied, how they studied it, and what they found
- Explain how your work will differ from or extend this study
- This will serve as your methodological foundation

### 3. Thematic Summary
Organize remaining papers by **1-2 key themes**. For example:

**For a project on "Dark Mode vs Light Mode":**
- Theme 1: Visual Comfort and Performance Studies
- Theme 2: User Preferences and Individual Differences

**Within each theme:**
- Synthesize what multiple papers found
- Note key methodological approaches
- Highlight main findings and contradictions

### 4. Research Gap
- What specific gap does your study address?
- How does it build on your proxy paper?
- Why is this gap important to fill?

### 5. References
- **Minimum 8-12 academic sources**
- Primarily from peer-reviewed venues (conferences/journals)
- Use proper APA format
- Include a mix of recent (last 5 years) and foundational papers

## Writing Tips for Beginners

### Do's:
- **Group papers by theme**, not chronologically
- **Synthesize** - show how papers relate to each other
- **Use your own voice** - don't just summarize
- **Be critical** - point out limitations and gaps
- **Connect back** to your research question throughout

### Don'ts:
- List papers one by one ("Paper A says... Paper B says...")
- Include non-academic sources as primary evidence
- Ignore papers that contradict your expectations
- Forget to explain why papers are relevant

### What Should Your Literature Review Look Like?

Your literature review should read like the "Related Work" or "Literature Review" sections you see in academic papers. Here are some examples:

#### Example 1: Thematic Organization (Dark Mode Research)
> **Visual Comfort and Eye Strain**
> 
> Several studies have examined the impact of dark mode on visual comfort. Smith et al. (2023) found that dark backgrounds reduced eye strain during extended reading sessions, particularly in low-light environments. Similarly, Chen and Rodriguez (2022) reported a 15% reduction in reported eye fatigue when participants used dark interfaces for coding tasks lasting over 2 hours. However, Jones & Wilson (2022) found mixed results, noting that the benefits varied significantly based on ambient lighting conditions and individual differences in visual sensitivity.
> 
> **Performance and Readability**
> 
> The impact of dark mode on task performance has yielded contradictory findings. While Martinez et al. (2023) observed improved reading speed on dark backgrounds for participants under 30, Thompson and Lee (2022) found no significant performance differences across age groups when controlling for screen brightness. These conflicting results suggest that context and individual factors play crucial roles in determining the effectiveness of dark mode interfaces.

#### Example 2: Identifying Gaps and Positioning Your Work
> **Research Gaps and Opportunities**
> 
> Despite growing interest in dark mode interfaces, several limitations exist in current research. First, most studies have focused on desktop environments (Smith et al., 2023; Chen & Rodriguez, 2022), leaving questions about mobile device usage largely unexplored. Second, existing work primarily examines short-term usage (under 3 hours), with little investigation of long-term adaptation effects. Finally, accessibility considerations for users with visual impairments remain understudied, despite dark mode being promoted as an accessibility feature.
> 
> These gaps suggest opportunities for research examining dark mode effectiveness in mobile contexts, long-term usage patterns, and accessibility implications for diverse user populations.

#### Example 3: Synthesis Across Multiple Studies
> **Trust in AI-Powered Interfaces**
> 
> User trust in AI-generated interfaces varies significantly across application domains and user characteristics. In the context of productivity tools, Davis et al. (2023) found that users expressed higher trust in AI-generated layouts for simple tasks (e.g., to-do lists) compared to complex workflows (e.g., data visualization dashboards). This finding aligns with the broader literature on AI trust, where Hoffman and Kumar (2022) demonstrated that perceived complexity negatively correlates with user acceptance. However, Park et al. (2023) challenged this relationship, showing that when users understood the AI's design rationale through explanatory interfaces, trust remained high even for complex applications. These findings collectively suggest that trust in AI-generated interfaces depends not only on task complexity but also on the transparency of the underlying design process.
