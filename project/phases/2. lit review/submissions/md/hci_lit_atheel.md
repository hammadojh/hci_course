Literature Review: Does Dark Mode vs. Light Mode Affect User Focus During Short Tasks 
in Productivity Apps? 
1) Introduction 
Productivity apps often support two visual themes—light mode (dark text on light background) 
and dark mode (light text on dark background). For short, glanceable tasks (e.g., scanning lists, 
triaging inbox items, copying numbers), “focus” typically shows up as speed and accuracy with 
low mental effort. Classic vision research points to a “positive polarity advantage,” where light 
mode improves legibility and proofreading, especially for small text. More recent HCI work 
complicates the picture: dark mode can reduce perceived workload and eye fatigue in some 
contexts, but objective performance effects vary with task and ambient light. This review 
synthesizes results to clarify which mode best supports focus during short tasks. Heinrich Heine 
University+2Europe PMC+2 
2) Proxy Paper 
Ettling et al. (ETRA ’25) ran an eye-tracking study on dashboard decision tasks (a close analog 
to short productivity tasks). Dark mode yielded lower perceived workload (NASA-TLX) across 
complexities, and higher accuracy at medium complexity, while task time differences were 
non-significant. Pupil dilation was higher in dark mode, yet users reported lower workload—
hinting that subjective comfort and objective arousal can diverge. I’ll use their measures (speed, 
accuracy, TLX, eye metrics) as a methodological template. alexandria.unisg.ch 
How my study will differ/extend: (a) focus explicitly on short tasks typical of productivity 
apps (e.g., quick selection, error spotting, copy-paste), (b) control ambient illumination typical 
of offices, and (c) stratify by age and display type to probe moderating effects suggested by 
prior work. alexandria.unisg.ch 
3) Thematic Summary 
Theme A: Reading/Glance Performance (speed & accuracy) 
A long line of lab studies shows light mode advantages for reading speed/accuracy and fine-
detail perception—the “positive polarity advantage”—with mechanisms linked to smaller pupils 
on brighter displays, improving retinal image sharpness. Effects strengthen with smaller text 
and persist across age groups. In HCI-relevant reading tasks (including glance reading), CHI’23 
work also found light mode reliably faster than dark. Together, this suggests that when short 
tasks hinge on quick text parsing, light mode tends to support focus (operationalized as 
fast/accurate throughput). thereadabilityconsortium.org+3Heinrich Heine

Theme B: Visual Comfort & Cognitive Load (eye strain, workload) 
Several newer studies report dark mode can reduce eye fatigue or subjective workload in 
certain conditions—even when objective speed/accuracy don’t improve. For example, on 
smartphones dark mode reduced self-reported eye fatigue under bright ambient light; on tablets, 
short-term physiology and symptoms differed modestly between modes; in dashboards, dark 
mode reduced perceived workload without a clear speed advantage. Age and lighting moderate 
effects: older adults and bright environments often show higher cognitive load with negative 
polarity; younger adults sometimes tolerate dark mode better in dim light. Europe

Representative findings 
• 
Dark mode lowered eye-fatigue in bright light (smartphone). thinkmind.org 
• 
Tablet study (1 h use): mode differences were small; some measures favored dark mode 
for comfort; overall fatigue rose over time in both modes. MDPI 
• 
Cognitive load varies with age and illumination; negative polarity can increase load for 
some groups. Europe PMC 
• 
In dashboard decision tasks, lower TLX in dark mode; time similar. alexandria.unisg.ch 
4) Synthesis & Answer to the Question 
For short productivity tasks where focus = fast, accurate micro-reads, the weight of evidence 
favors light mode due to well-replicated positive polarity benefits on legibility and glance 
performance. However, dark mode can feel easier (lower workload) and reduce eye fatigue in 
some settings—especially bright ambient light or prolonged sessions—without necessarily 
speeding task completion. In practice: 
• 
If your short tasks are text-heavy and time-sensitive, default to light mode. Heinrich 
Heine University+1 
• 
If users report visual discomfort (or work in bright conditions), dark mode may 
improve comfort even if speed/accuracy don’t change. thinkmind.org+1 
• 
Expect individual differences (age, vision, preferences) and task-type/lighting 
interactions. Europe PMC

5) Research Gap & Proposed Focus 
We still lack controlled, app-context studies on very short, productivity-specific tasks (e.g., 
inbox triage, code-copy, quick sort/filter) comparing modes under typical office lighting and 
modern displays (OLED/LCD). I would extend Ettling et al. by: 
• 
Tasks: 10–30 s trials for scanning, copy-verify, error-spotting. 
• 
Measures: Time, accuracy, NASA-TLX; pupillometry for arousal; brief visual-fatigue 
checklist. 
• 
Factors: Mode (light/dark), ambient light (dim/office/bright), age group (18–35 vs 50+), 
display type. 
This directly targets whether mode meaningfully shifts short-task focus beyond 
comfort. alexandria.unisg.ch
