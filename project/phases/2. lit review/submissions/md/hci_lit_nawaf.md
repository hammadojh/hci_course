Introduction 
Process work in HR systems—such as organizing a set of employee Performance 
Evaluations—requires sustained attention across repetitive, detail-oriented screens 
(ratings, comments, calibration notes). Over long periods, visual theming (dark vs. light) 
may influence workload, accuracy, and time-on-task. While newer HCI work on 
dashboards and visualization indicates mixed, task and user-dependent results, classic 
visual-ergonomics research often reports a positive-polarity advantage (black text on light 
background) for small-text precision and proofreading capabilities. Crucially, most studies 
are brief and do not specifically assess attention span during lengthy, frequently 
interrupted sessions that are typical of HR review cycles. 

Proxy Paper 
A within-subjects eye-tracking study on dashboard decision-making with dark versus light 
themes and different task complexity was conducted by Ettling, Steinmann, Bektaş, and 
Abbad-Andaloussi (2025). Completion time, accuracy, confidence, fixation counts, pupil 
dilation, and NASA-TLX workload were among the metrics. Although there is no overall 
dominance, the results show situational benefits for dark mode (e.g., reduced workload, 
fewer fixations, sometimes improved accuracy at medium complexity). This serves as 
an effective measurement template and emphasizes the necessity of testing longer 
sessions and realistic workflows as a stand-in for HR dashboards (ratings summaries, 
drilldowns, infographics). 
Theme 1 — Visual Performance (speed/accuracy) on Text-Heavy Tasks 
According to foundational polarity studies, light mode improves reading and verification 
ability, particularly for dense text and small fonts. This is explained by the fact that a higher 
display brightness results in narrower pupils and a sharper retinal picture. This research 
forecast’s light theme advantages in micro-accuracy and scan speed for HR review forms 
containing fine text (policy notes, competency definitions, lengthy comments). These 
findings, nevertheless, are based on reading and proofreading exercises and might not 
translate exactly to mixed user interface screens.

Theme 2 — Workload, Attention & Prospects for Focus Span in Dashboards 
Where tasks involve summarizing charts/tables (calibration views, bell curves, KPI tiles), 
contrast polarity effects are heterogeneous. There was no single best mode in a 
visualization study with 134 participants; instead, the better-performing polarity differed by 
person and average differences were small, supporting the idea of providing both modes. 
However, at some complexity levels, the proxy paper displays fewer fixations in dark mode 
and a reduced workload, which are indicators of a possibly slower rate of performance 
degradation as sessions get longer (albeit the trials were brief). All of data indicates that 
dark mode may be useful in certain dashboard situations, but not always, and that the 
benefits of prolonged use are still unproven. 
 
Theme 3 — Comfort/Fatigue as Mediators (Ambient Light Matters) 
Studies isolating fatigue (rather than performance) show context-dependent effects. Dark 
mode on smartphones decreased self-reported eye fatigue in bright ambient light, but it 
had no effect on dim light. A study on tablets discovered that both modes gradually 
increased fatigue, with dark mode occasionally lowering the risk of dry eyes. Although they 
are not performance assessments, reduced effort and weariness may help maintain 
concentration during lengthy HR review batches, particularly when using high-bright 
laptops or under bright office lighting. 
 
Theme 4 — Moderators: User Traits, Typography/Contrast, and Policy Screens 
Guidelines and reviews caution that for users with normal or enhanced vision, light mode 
often yields better visual performance; dark mode may benefit glare-sensitive users, 
certain low-light contexts, or OLED devices (reduced glare/halation). Numerous 
inconsistencies can be attributed to methodological decisions about font size/weight, line-
height, and WCAG contrast. HR review user interfaces frequently blend visual summaries 
(ratings distributions) with fine text (policy/legal). It is therefore more reasonable to utilize 
context-aware theming (or user-selectable theming) with carefully adjusted font 
size/contrast rather than assuming a universal dark-mode speed improvement, as a single 
global theme may not be ideal.

Gap & How Your Study Contributes 
Most dark vs. light studies: (a) use short trials (minutes, not 45–90 minutes), 
(b) focus on reading or simple chart tasks instead of full process flows (search → read → 
rate → comment → calibrate), 
and (c) rarely model interruptions or attention lapses that occur in HR cycles. Empirical 
evidence directly answering, “Does dark mode prolong focus span during process 
work?” is scarce. 
Your study (building on Ettling et al.) should: 
1. Within-subjects comparison of dark vs. light themes on a Performance-Review 
workflow (multi-employee batch). 
2. Extended sessions (≥60 min) to capture focus span and performance-over-time 
(time/employee, micro-errors, backtracks). 
3. Objective attention metrics (eye-tracking: fixation count/length, blink rate; 
optional keystroke pauses) + NASA-TLX each block. 
4. Ambient-light manipulation (bright office vs. dim) and typography/contrast 
controls (WCAG-compliant variants). 
5. User traits (vision, age, habitual theme preference) to analyze moderation. 
Hypothesis (patterned on the literature): Dark mode will not uniformly increase 
performance. It may lower workload and slow performance decay—thus prolonging 
effective focus span—for some users and lighting/device conditions (e.g., bright 
environments with high-glare displays), while light mode remains superior for fine-print, 
precision text portions of the flow.
