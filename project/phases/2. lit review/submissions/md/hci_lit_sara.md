generations may misinterpret?

1. Introduction 
Emojis are now a central layer of digital interaction, adding nuance, tone, and affecting 
that plain text often fails to convey. However, their meanings are not fixed. Younger users, 
especially Gen-Z, frequently re-appropriate emojis for irony, exaggeration, or humor for 
example, meaning “amazing” or to mean “hilarious.” By contrast, older adults often 
interpret emojis more literally, such as for “fire” or “emergency.” These mismatches 
introduce opportunities for misunderstanding, even in everyday exchanges. 
Prior research shows that this ambiguity arises both from user interpretation and from the 
emoji system itself: rendering differences across platforms and cultures shift meanings 
unpredictably. A consistent theme across studies is that adding short textual context 
stabilizes interpretation, reducing disagreement between users and enhancing clarity in 
communication. 
2. Proxy Paper 
The methodological foundation for this research is Miller et al (2017), who directly tested 
whether accompanying text reduces emoji misinterpretation. Their study compared emoji 
only prompts with emoji plus text conditions and demonstrated that even minimal text 
significantly improved agreement on intended meaning. 
Our study extends their approach by introducing automatic clarification mechanisms, rather 
than relying on users to type explanatory text. In addition, our work explicitly compares 
younger and older populations to examine whether automatic clarifiers can mitigate 
generational misinterpretation gaps.

3. Thematic Summary 
• Theme A: Ambiguity and Context 
Large scale analyses confirm that many emojis are inherently ambiguous without context. 
Czestochowska et al (2022) demonstrated that only a small subset of emojis is consistently 
interpreted, with most showing wide variance across users. Similarly, Zhou et al (2024) 
showed that cross-linguistic variations exacerbate this ambiguity. At the same time, studies 
consistently highlight that short textual additions even single words can reduce 
disagreement and stabilize meaning (Miller et al 2017; Riordan, 2017). Together, these 
findings justify exploring lightweight clarification mechanisms that preserve expressiveness 
while reducing misinterpretation. 
• Theme B: Generational Differences 
Generational factors significantly influence emoji use. Herring and Dainas (2020) found that 
older adults tend to interpret emojis functionally and literally, while younger users adopt 
them for irony, creativity, and affective expression. 
More recent work, however, complicates this picture: Kempe & Raviv (2025) reported no 
major generational differences when measuring agreement on the meanings of face emojis 
such as or . Their findings suggest that for highly conventionalized emojis, 
interpretations may converge across age groups. 
 However, this scope is limited: they focused only on face emojis in isolation, without testing 
reappropriated symbols (e.g., for “that’s hilarious”) or contextualized social 
messaging. Earlier studies (Miller et al 2017; Herring & Dainas, 2020) consistently show that 
ambiguity increases when emojis are used creatively or sarcastically, which is where Gen-Z 
practices diverge most. Our study specifically targets these reappropriated uses, asking 
whether automatic clarifiers can reduce misinterpretation across generations in 
naturalistic conversations.

4. Research Gap 
The reviewed literature establishes three key insights: 
1. Emoji meanings are frequently ambiguous. 
2. Supplemental text reduces misinterpretation. 
3. Age and generational background influence interpretation styles. 
Yet no prior study has evaluated automatic clarifiers lightweight, system generated text 
explanations across age groups. Existing approaches assume users will provide clarifying 
text, which is unrealistic in fast paced digital conversations. 
Our proposed study directly addresses this gap by testing whether automatic clarifiers 
reduce intergenerational misinterpretation in messaging contexts. The research design is a 
2×2 factorial: Generation (Gen-Z vs. ≥35) × Cue Type (emoji-only vs. emoji+clarifier). This 
structure builds on Miller et al (2017), extends to generational factors, and evaluates the 
feasibility of automated clarification mechanisms in real world communication.
