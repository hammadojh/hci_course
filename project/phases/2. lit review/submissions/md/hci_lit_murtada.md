Literature Review: Notification Feedback 
Mechanisms and Their Impact on Focus and 
Productivity in Deep Work Sessions 
Introduction 
In today's digital workplace, desk-based employees frequently engage in deep work sessions—
periods of concentrated, uninterrupted focus essential for high-productivity tasks such as 
analysis, writing, or problem-solving. However, smartphone and computer notifications, 
delivered through haptic (vibratory), audio (sound-based), and visual (screen-based) cues, often 
disrupt these sessions, potentially impairing attention and output. This is a critical area in 
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and occupational psychology, as excessive interruptions can 
lead to reduced efficiency, increased stress, and lower overall well-being. Understanding these 
effects is vital for designing better workplace tools and policies to enhance productivity. The 
specific research question guiding this review is: How do different notification feedback 
mechanisms (haptic, audio, and visual cues) affect desk-based employees' focus and productivity 
during their deep work sessions? 
Proxy Paper 
A key proxy paper for this research is "Effects of Information Widgets on Time Perception 
during Mentally Demanding Tasks" by Li et al. (2025). This study investigated how multimodal 
information widgets (visual, auditory, and haptic modes) influence time perception, cognitive 
performance, and emotional responses in office-like mentally demanding environments using a 
prototype called Tick Sens. Through a within-subjects experiment with 30 participants, the 
authors compared these modes against blank and timer baselines, assessing technology 
acceptance, task performance, and emotions via self-reports and performance metrics. Key 
findings showed that all three modalities improved cognitive performance and positive emotions 
compared to baselines: visual modes excelled in task performance, auditory cues boosted focus, 
and haptic feedback enhanced user acceptance, with varied preferences among users. 
This paper serves as a methodological foundation due to its similar focus on multimodal cues in 
demanding tasks, akin to deep work. Our proposed study will extend it by specifically targeting 
desk-based employees in real-world deep work sessions (e.g., 1-2 hour focused periods), 
incorporating productivity measures like task completion rates and self-reported focus 
disruption, and exploring long-term effects over multiple days rather than single sessions. This

addresses the proxy's limitation of short-term lab-based evaluation by applying similar 
experimental designs in naturalistic office settings. 
Thematic Summary 
Theme 1: Impact of Multimodal Notifications on Performance and Strain 
Research consistently demonstrates that haptic, audio, and visual notifications can interrupt 
tasks, affecting performance and increasing strain, though effects vary by individual factors. For 
instance, Ohly and Bastin (2023) conducted a field experiment with 247 participants, finding that 
disabling notifications for one day reduced interruptions, leading to higher perceived 
productivity and lower strain, particularly for those with medium-to-high telepressure (social 
pressure to respond quickly) or low-to-medium fear of missing out (Fo MO). Visual, auditory, 
and haptic cues averaged 65.3 daily interruptions, negatively impacting performance via 
distraction, but no rise in internal interruptions occurred for high-Fo MO individuals. Similarly, 
Kushlev et al. (2016) in a two-week experiment with 221 participants showed that enabling 
auditory, tactile, and visual alerts increased inattention and hyperactivity symptoms, correlating 
with lower productivity and well-being; minimizing alerts by silencing and stowing phones 
reversed these effects. However, Pielot and Rello (2017) found mixed results in a 24-hour 
notification disablement study, where participants reported increased productivity but also 
anxiety and loneliness, suggesting emotional trade-offs in interruption reduction. 
These studies highlight agreements on the disruptive potential of multimodal cues but reveal 
contradictions: while Ohly and Bastin emphasize benefits for specific personality types, Kushlev 
et al. indicate broader negative impacts on attention, underscoring the need for personalized 
interventions. 
Theme 2: Efficiency and Interference of Notification Modalities in Task 
Contexts 
Studies on modality preferences in multi-device or immersive settings reveal that combined cues 
can enhance awareness but often cause interference, depending on context and timing. Abreu et 
al. (2016) tested visual, audio, and haptic notifications in second-screen TV scenarios with 30 
participants, finding that a combination of visual (on TV) and haptic (on tablet) cues, spaced at 
least 30 seconds apart, was most efficient for alerting without excessive disturbance, though all 
modalities caused some cognitive interference to primary tasks. Ghosh et al. (2018) explored 
similar modalities in VR, prototyping notifications to minimize shifts from immersion; haptic 
and audio cues were less disruptive than visual for maintaining focus, but all attracted immediate 
attention, potentially reducing productivity in high-concentration activities. Cidota et al. (2016) 
compared audio and visual notifications in AR remote collaboration, noting that audio cues

better preserved local workers' focus by avoiding visual overload, though combined use risked 
divided attention. 
Synthesis across these papers shows haptic cues often reduce visual clutter for better acceptance, 
while audio aids focus in visually demanding tasks; contradictions arise in interference levels, 
with Abreu et al. favoring visual-haptic pairs for efficiency, versus Cidota et al.'s preference for 
audio to minimize distraction. 
Research Gap 
Despite insights into notification modalities, a key gap persists in studies directly examining their 
differential effects on focus and productivity during prolonged deep work sessions for desk-
based employees. Most research, like Li et al. (2025), focuses on short-term lab tasks or specific 
contexts (e.g., VR, AR, second-screens), with limited exploration of real-office deep work (e.g., 
1-2+ hours without breaks). Contradictory findings on modality superiority—visual for 
performance (Li et al., 2025) versus audio for focus (Cidota et al., 2016)—highlight the need for 
context-specific comparisons. Additionally, individual differences like Fo MO (Ohly & Bastin, 
2023) are underexplored in deep work scenarios. Our study addresses this by building on Li et 
al.'s methodology to test modalities in authentic desk-based deep work, filling this gap to inform 
better notification designs for workplace productivity and well-being.
