# Research Proposal & Study Design Guide

## What is a Research Proposal?

A research proposal is your detailed plan for conducting an HCI study that transforms your literature review insights into actionable research. **Your proposal should read like the "Methods" sections in academic papers** - providing sufficient detail for replication.

**It's NOT:**
- A vague description of what you might do
- A copy-paste of your proxy paper's methodology
- A theoretical discussion without concrete plans

**It IS:**
- A detailed, executable plan adapted from your proxy paper
- A comprehensive design addressing your research gap
- A demonstration of rigorous HCI research capability

## Goals

Transform abstract concepts into measurable variables, adapt proven methodologies to your context, plan data collection, anticipate challenges, and establish feasibility within course constraints.

## Building on Your Literature Review

Your proxy paper serves as your **methodological template**. Extract the core method, adapt to your context, address identified gaps, and improve upon limitations.

**Example Adaptation:**
> **Gap**: "Most dark mode studies focus on desktop environments, leaving mobile contexts unexplored."
> **Proxy Method**: Laboratory experiment comparing reading performance on desktop computers
> **Your Adaptation**: "We will adapt Smith et al.'s experimental design to mobile devices, adding mobile-specific measures like one-handed usage and outdoor lighting."

## What to Submit

Your research proposal should be **2-3 pages maximum** and include:

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip for Success**: Focus on specificity and detail. Reviewers should be able to understand exactly what you plan to do, how you'll do it, and why your approach is sound.

### 1. Research Question & Hypotheses

**Research Question**: Clear, specific, addressing your literature gap and building on your proxy paper.

**Hypotheses**: Testable predictions with expected direction of effects.

**Example**:
> **RQ**: How does haptic feedback in mobile interfaces affect task accuracy and satisfaction during one-handed operation?
> **H1**: Participants will show higher accuracy with haptic vs. visual-only feedback.
> **H2**: Users will report higher satisfaction and lower cognitive load with haptic feedback.

### 2. Methodology

**Study Design**: Type (between/within-subjects), variables (independent/dependent/control), and measurement approach.

**Participants**: Target population, sample size with justification, recruitment strategy, compensation.
> *Example: 24 students (18-25), smartphone users (â‰¥3hrs daily), recruited via university lists, $15 for 45min.*

**Materials**: Hardware/software specifications, interface designs, measurement instruments, environment setup.

**Procedure**: Step-by-step protocol with counterbalancing and session timeline.
> *Example: (1) Consent/demographics (5min), (2) Training (10min), (3) Tasks in both conditions (25min), (4) Questionnaire (5min)*

### 3. Measures & Analysis Plan

**Data Collection**: Objective measures (performance, physiological) and subjective measures (questionnaires, ratings).

**Analysis Strategy**: Statistical tests/qualitative methods, significance criteria, software, data handling.

**Example**:
> **Measures**: Task time/accuracy, NASA-TLX workload, satisfaction ratings
> **Analysis**: Repeated-measures ANOVA, Wilcoxon tests, Î±=0.05, partial Î·Â² effect sizes

### 4. Timeline & Feasibility

**Schedule**: Week-by-week breakdown, milestones, buffer time for delays.
**Risk Assessment**: Challenges, backup plans, resource requirements.

**Example**: *Week 9: Materials/pilot, Week 10-11: Data collection, Week 12: Analysis*

### 5. Ethical Considerations & Expected Contributions

**Ethics**: IRB approval, informed consent, privacy protection, risk mitigation.
**Contributions**: Theoretical insights, practical implications, methodological improvements, limitations.
