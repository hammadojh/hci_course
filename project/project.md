# SWE 503: Project (Term paper) description.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to engage students in an in-depth exploration of a specific topic within the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Each student will select a topic of interest, conduct comprehensive research, and contribute original insights to the academic discourse in HCI.

## Project Scope
Each student will choose a topic related to current trends, challenges, or innovations in HCI. Possible areas include, but are not limited to:

- User Experience (UX) Design
- Interaction Design
- Accessibility and Inclusive Design
- Tangible User Interfaces
- Virtual and Augmented Reality
- Social Computing
- Ethics in HCI
- Cognitive Modeling in HCI
- Human-Robot Interaction
- Affective Computing

You can explore more topics by browsing conferences listed under the [SigCHI](https://sigchi.org/) website. 

## Expectations
Students are expected to:

1. Identify a specific research question or problem within their chosen topic.
2. Conduct a thorough review of existing literature to frame their research within the current state of knowledge.
3. Develop and apply appropriate research methods to investigate their research question. This could include qualitative studies, quantitative experiments, or a mixed-methods approach.
4. Analyze the collected data or synthesized information, drawing meaningful conclusions that contribute to the understanding of the chosen topic.
5. Compile their findings into a well-structured research paper, adhering to academic standards of writing and referencing.
6. Present their research findings to the class in a formal presentation, followed by a Q&A session to foster discussion and feedback.
