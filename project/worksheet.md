# 📝 HCI Research Question Generator (Worksheet)

## Step 1: Choose an **Interaction Context**

*(Where the interaction happens)*
☐ Mobile app
☐ Website
☐ Chatbot / AI Assistant
☐ Virtual or Augmented Reality
☐ Video call / Collaboration tool
☐ Smartwatch / Wearable
☐ Voice Assistant (Alexa, Siri, etc.)
☐ Other: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## Step 2: Pick a **Design Variable**

*(What you will compare or test)*
☐ Interaction mode (touch vs. gesture, voice vs. text)
☐ Visual style (dark vs. light mode, animated vs. static)
☐ AI involvement (with vs. without autocomplete, human vs. AI-generated)
☐ Information presentation (notification type, emoji, icons, layout)
☐ Accessibility feature (captions on/off, screen reader, contrast level)
☐ Feedback mechanism (haptic, audio, visual cues)
☐ Other: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## Step 3: Decide on a **Human Outcome**

*(What you will measure in users)*
☐ Efficiency (task completion time, error rate)
☐ Experience (usability, satisfaction, trust, confidence)
☐ Well-being (focus, stress, eye strain)
☐ Social perception (connectedness, empathy, inclusiveness)
☐ Understanding (accuracy, interpretation differences)
☐ Other: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## Step 4: Combine into a Research Question

Formula:

**In \[context], does \[design variable] affect \[human outcome]?**

Examples:

* In **mobile apps**, does **dark mode** affect **eye strain**?
* In **VR**, do **gesture controls** feel more **natural** than touch controls?
* In **chatbots**, does **task type** influence **trust**?
* In **video calls**, do **emoji reactions** increase **connectedness**?

✅ **Final Check**

* Is the project feasible in **1 month**?
* Can I test it with **5–15 participants** or a quick survey?
* Does it connect to an **HCI research theme** (UX, accessibility, trust, VR, social computing, etc.)?
