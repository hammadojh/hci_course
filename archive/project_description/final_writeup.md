## Full writeup phase

Below are the instructions for the "Full Writeup" phase, which includes creating the Abstract, Introduction, Discussion, Conclusion, and Future Work sections. Additionally, you will refine previously developed sections (e.g., Study Design, Data Analysis, and Results). These instructions are informed by best practices in scientific writing, as outlined in the referenced resource ([Dunkin Lab Guide](https://dunkin.eeb.ucsc.edu/images/documents/How_to_write_a_scientific_paper.pdf)) and aligned with prior phases of your study.

### Objectives of the Full Writeup Phase

1. **Synthesize the Entire Study:** Present the full narrative of your research from motivation and background to methodology, results, and implications, culminating in a coherent document.
2. **Refine Previous Sections:** Revisit and polish previously drafted sections (Study Design, Data Collection, Data Analysis, and Results) to ensure clarity, consistency, and scientific rigor.
3. **Ensure Coherence and Logical Flow:** Each section should logically lead to the next, forming a cohesive story that clearly communicates your research question, methods, findings, and contributions to the field of HCI.
4. **Engage with the Literature and Context:** Situate your findings within the broader research landscape, referencing related work and clarifying how your research advances knowledge.
5. **Highlight Contributions and Future Directions:** Emphasize the significance of your findings, discuss their limitations, and suggest areas for future exploration.

### Sections to Include

#### 1. Abstract

**Why:**
Provide a concise summary of the entire study. Include background context, the research question or objective, methodology, key results, and main conclusions. Keep the abstract between 150–250 words, ensuring it can stand alone in communicating the essence of your work.

**How to write:**  
- Start by stating the problem or gap addressed by the study.
- Briefly describe the research approach or methodology.
- Highlight the main findings and their significance.
- Conclude with a statement on the implications or impact of the results on HCI research and practice.

#### 2. Introduction

**Why:**
Present the research problem, including its relevance and importance within the HCI field. Review key related literature to situate your work and identify the research gap. Clearly state the research question(s) or hypothesis. Explain the rationale, objectives, and expected contributions of the study.

**How to write:**  
- Begin broadly by introducing the context of your research domain.
- Narrow down to the specific problem, highlighting gaps or limitations in existing research.
- End with a clear articulation of your research question(s) and the significance of your study.

#### 3. Methods (Refinement of Study Design)

**Why:**
Provide a refined and cohesive narrative of the methodology, combining content from previous design and data collection sections. Describe the study type, participant recruitment, materials, and procedure in a succinct but comprehensive manner. Justify your methodological choices and discuss any changes made after pilot testing. Ensure that a reader could replicate the study based on your methods description.

#### 4. Results (Refinement of Data Analysis and Findings)

**Why:**
Present the analyzed data and key findings clearly and objectively, refining any initial results from the previous phase. Use tables, graphs, and visual aids effectively to support textual explanations. 

**How to write:**  
- Present the analyzed data and key findings clearly and objectively, refining any initial results from the previous phase.
- Use tables, graphs, and visual aids effectively to support textual explanations.
- Focus on addressing the research questions or hypotheses directly.

#### 5. Discussion

**Why:**
Interpret your findings in the context of the research questions and existing literature. Highlight how the results support, contradict, or extend current knowledge in HCI. Discuss potential reasons for unexpected findings and acknowledge limitations. Emphasize the practical and theoretical implications of your work.

**How to write:**  
- Connect findings back to the introduction, revisiting the research questions.
- Discuss the broader relevance of your results to users, practitioners, and researchers.
- Acknowledge any methodological constraints and suggest explanations for the observed outcomes.

#### 6. Conclusion

**Why:**
Summarize the main insights derived from the study. Reinforce the importance and impact of your findings on HCI practice and research. Provide a clear, concise synthesis of what has been learned.

### Additional Considerations

- **Cohesive Narrative:** Ensure all sections form a logical narrative. The introduction sets the stage, the methods detail the approach, the results present findings, and the discussion interprets those findings, culminating in meaningful conclusions and future directions.
- **Clarity and Precision:** Employ clear, concise, and unambiguous language. Avoid jargon when possible and define technical terms for the reader.
- **Citation and Referencing:** Properly cite all sources referenced in the introduction and discussion. Follow a consistent citation style (e.g., APA, ACM, IEEE).
- **Formatting and Style:** Follow the formatting guidelines required by your institution, conference, or journal. Ensure figures, tables, and references are formatted properly.
