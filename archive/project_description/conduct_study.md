### Conducting the Study and Collecting Data

In this phase, you will execute the study design, collect empirical data, and ensure that data collection procedures align with your study goals. This phase is critical as it translates your theoretical planning into practical insights. 

**Steps for Conducting the Study**

1. **Recruit Participants**

   - Implement your recruitment strategy, ensuring participants meet the inclusion criteria.
   - Confirm participation through communication and establish informed consent.

2. **Prepare the Study Environment**

   - Set up the environment (e.g., remote setup) according to the study type.
   - Ensure all tools, materials, and technology needed for data collection are functional and tested.

3. **Participant Briefing**

   - Welcome participants, introduce the study, and provide a clear overview of their tasks.
   - Outline ethical considerations, including privacy, confidentiality, and data usage.
   - Address participant questions and confirm informed consent (signature).

4. **Data Collection Execution**

   - Follow the study protocol strictly, ensuring consistency in participant handling.
   - Collect both qualitative and quantitative data as required (e.g., task completion times, error rates, user feedback).
   - Use tools such as screen recordings, surveys and observation logs

5. **Monitoring and Observation**

   - Observe participant behavior, taking detailed notes of significant interactions.
   - Use think-aloud protocols where applicable, recording participants' thoughts during tasks to gain insights into their experiences.

6. **Post-Study Debriefing**

   - Conduct post-study interviews or surveys to collect additional feedback from participants.
   - Thank participants for their time, provide compensation if applicable, and reassure them regarding data confidentiality.

7. **Data Quality Control**

   - Review collected data to identify incomplete or inconsistent entries.
   - Address any quality issues immediately (e.g., data discrepancies or participant misunderstandings).


**Documentation Requirements**

- **Participant Details Log** Maintain a record of all participants, including demographics and consent status.
- **Observation Notes** Document important observations, including deviations from the protocol or noteworthy participant reactions.
- **Collected Data Records** Keep all collected data organized and backed up securely for later analysis.

**Rubric for Evaluation**

| **Criteria**                          | **Excellent (100%)**                                                                        | **Good (75%)**                                                                           | **Satisfactory (50%)**                                                                      | **Needs Improvement (25%)**                                                   | **Unsatisfactory (0%)**                                                       |

| **Participant Recruitment (15 pts)**  | Participants recruited meet inclusion criteria perfectly, consent well documented.          | Recruitment largely meets criteria with minor deviations; consent documented adequately. | Recruitment meets most criteria, but some deviations exist; consent documented.             | Recruitment has significant deviations from criteria; issues with consent.    | Recruitment poorly conducted or consent not properly documented.              |
| **Study Execution (20 pts)**          | Study executed precisely as planned, with adherence to all procedures; no major issues.     | Study executed with minor deviations; participants handled consistently overall.         | Some issues in execution; deviations in procedure noted but did not greatly impact results. | Significant issues with procedure execution; impacts the reliability of data. | Study not conducted as planned; major deviations compromising data integrity. |
| **Data Collection (25 pts)**          | Comprehensive data collection; all required data gathered systematically with no omissions. | Data collection mostly complete, but minor gaps exist; systematic approach followed.     | Data collection has some gaps; systematic approach inconsistently applied.                  | Data collection has notable gaps; lack of systematic methodology.             | Data collection incomplete; major omissions affecting study outcomes.         |
| **Data Quality Monitoring (15 pts)**  | Consistent monitoring of data quality; no discrepancies or issues with collected data.      | Data quality monitoring mostly consistent; few minor issues identified and resolved.     | Some monitoring of data quality; several minor issues left unaddressed.                     | Limited data quality checks; multiple discrepancies not addressed.            | No data quality monitoring; significant issues with data integrity.           |
