<!-- 

Goals today:

By the end of this lecture students will be able to:

- Define if an interface design is good or not.
- Know about systemaic ways to decide if a design is good or not
- Know about systematic ways to build good designs
- Practice evaluating interfaces using greedy methods

# Defining **"Good"** User Interfaces 
Dr. Omar Hammad

## In today's lecture

- What is a good interface?
- Systematic ways to build & evaluate interfaces.
- Practice evaluating interfaces 

---

# User Interface?

<!-- Let students think of what is an interface -->

---

<!-- _class: left -->

# A User interface is:
### Set of all the components of an interactive system that **provide information and controls** for the user to **accomplish specific tasks** with the interactive system
-ISO

<!-- _class: activity -->

~ 10 mins
# Write down a short paragraph about your last experience in interacting with a software system?
Then share your experience .. 

<!-- You will hear from peopls experiences and they will say some keywords that you can use later -->

---

# Can we quantify/measure an experience?

<!-- Have a discussion with them .. -->

---

<!-- _class: left -->

# Revision of user goals in .. 

- Uber Mobile App? 
<!-- Get delivered -->
- MS teams?
<!-- Communicate -->
- Smart lock
<!-- Open/lock door -->

---

<!-- _class: boxes -->

# A good interface is measured by:

- User Performance 
- User Perception 

---

<!-- _class: left -->

# User Performance 
- Could users achive their goal? (Effectiveness)
- How fast could they achive it? (Effeciency)
- Did they commit any mistakes? (Error Rate)
- Could they remember next time? (Learnability)
...

---

<!-- _class: left -->

# User Perception
- How satisfying was it? (Satisfaction)
- Do they trust the system? (Trust)
- How convincing was it? (Authentic)
- Did they enjoy it? (Enjoyment)
...

---

# Which is more important?

---

<!-- _class: left -->

# Importance change based on context & user goals.. 
- Banking (Trust > Enjoyment)
- Education (Enjoyment > Error rate)
- Games (Excitement > Learnability)

---

<!-- _class: activity -->

~ 10 mins
# Go back to the same experience and try to evaluate it using Performance & Perception metrics ..
Then share your experience .. 

<!-- You will hear from peopls experiences and they will say some keywords that you can use later -->

---

<!-- _class: left -->

# Are there well defined methods to ensure that we build good interfaces? 

---

<!-- _class: left -->

# Are there well defined methods to ensure that we build good interfaces? 
- Design processes 
- Design principles 
- Research Methods 
- Evaluation Methods 

---

<!-- _class: boxes -->

---

<!-- _class: boxes -->

# Design Principles

# Next Week 
- The Double Diamon Process
- Read Chapter 1 of *Interaction Design, Beyond Human-Computer Interaction*
- Pay attention to BB announcements
