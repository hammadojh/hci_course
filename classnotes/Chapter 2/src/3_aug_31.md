<!-- 

Goals today:

By the end of this lecture students will be able to:

- Understand the general process of interaction design 
- Able to know what is envolved in each phase of it 
- Practice the interaction design process on a mini scale 
- Appreciate the process 

How (idea):
- make them work independently, without the process at first 
- explain the core of the processes (history, big idea, 4 phases ..)
- explain each phase in details with a running example 
- let them go with you phase by phase .. 
- later let them apply the process on a group setting

# The Interaction Design Process
Dr. Omar Hammad

---

<!-- _class: left -->

# Revision of the last lecture:

- What is a "good" design?
- What are some metrics to evaluate interactions?
- Colors & Fonts are important in interaction design, right?
- Why?
- What else matters, maybe more?

---

<!-- _class: left -->

# In today's lecture:

- Hear from people who did not share their experience last time
- What are the core principles of interaction design?
- What is the process of interaction design?
- The double diamond process
- A running example of the interaction design process

<!-- _class: activity -->


<!-- Before we explain the process let them design a solution for the following problem -->

~ 15 minutes
# Pick one problem from your previous interaction and Sketch one design to enahnce it ..

---

<!-- How can we make sure to maximize the positive metrics -->

# Design is about maximizing user's **ability** to achieve their goals with the best **experience** possible ..

<!-- _class: boxes -->

# How to maximize metrics?

- Processes 
- Methodologies

# Before we get into a specific process ...

let's talk about the core principle & general approach in HCI

---

<!-- _class: boxes -->

# People-Centered Approach
By John Gould & Clayton Lewis (1985)

- Early focus on users and tasks
- Empirical measurement
- Iterative design

---

<!-- _class: left -->

# Core Principles of People-Centered Approach
- Early focus on users and tasks
- Empirical measurement
- Iterative design
- People's tasks and goals drive development
- People's behavior and context are studied
- People's characteristics are considered
- Users and stakeholders are consulted
- Design decisions consider context of use

<!-- 
Explanations:
- Early focus on users and tasks: Understand users' cognitive, behavioral, anthropomorphic, and attitudinal characteristics; observe users performing normal tasks; actively involve users in design process
- Empirical measurement: Observe and measure user reactions to materials (scenarios, manuals, etc.); test with simulations and prototypes; record and analyze user performance
- Iterative design: Fix problems identified during user testing; conduct more tests to evaluate changes; repeat "design-test-measure-redesign" cycles
- People's tasks and goals drive development: Technology informs design options, but is not the primary driver; focus on identifying technologies that support people's goals
- People's behavior and context are studied: Understand how people perform tasks, not just what tasks they do; reveals users' priorities, preferences, and implicit intentions
- People's characteristics are considered: Account for cognitive limitations (attention, memory, perception); consider physical aspects (height, mobility, strength); design for both general (e.g., color blindness - 4.5% of population) and specific characteristics
- Users and stakeholders are consulted: From earliest phases to the latest; different levels of involvement and various consultation methods
- Design decisions consider context of use: People's activities and environment; active user involvement in design decisions; co-creation as an effective approach

# 1/4 Discover
To understand, rather than simply assume

Example
# We need to design a way for non-tech entrepreneurs to build software products on their own ... 

Think of some reseach questions .. ??

<!-- Questions include: 
 
 - Who are my users? 
 - what do they know? 
 - why might they be interested in this?
 - What are their current challenges?
 - What values do they care about? 
 - What is their current situation in solving the problem?
 - In what context do they use the product?

 ... other relevent questions ..

~ 15 minutes
# Team up with someone and do some reasearch then present your findings ..
- Who are the cusomters (goals, needs, frustrations, etc.)? 
- In What context they are using the product? 
- What are some existing solutions?

# Define activities include:

- Clustering, affinity diagram, etc.
- Analyze data (quantitative, qualitative, etc.)
- Mapping (empathy map, scenario, journey map, etc.)
- Problem Definition
