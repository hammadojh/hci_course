MY goal of today's class is:

- Complete the emotional aspects 
- Start and finish the social aspects 

Within each topic: 

Emotional Aspect: 

- Link with the previous lecture
- Questions about emotions 
- We said that emotions fluctuates 
- It affects people's behaviour 
- It is user dependent
- SO it is essential to understand and be able to detect them
- becuase if we do so we will be able to build influecing emotions 

- We also said that some interactions are expressive and some are intrusive
- We will start today by the differene between expressive and intrusive interactions
- Let's start by sharing couple of examples .. 
- Now I want you to search the web and present an expressive / intrusive interaction 
- Why ? 

- One of the big mistakes that we do and it causes user frustration is allowing them to fall into errors. 
- A golden rule here is never blame the user.
